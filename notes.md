# Communicating With The Server

## Reminder of 3 pillars of web programming

1. Manipulating the DOM
2. Creating Events
3. Communicating with the server

## AJAX

* Stands for: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
* Make requests to the server without reloading web page
* Moves fast and keeps user experience positive
* User see’s html and css, and behind the scenes JS fills in the rest of the action we want the page to offer
* Data sent back from the server is not html, it is JSON
* Allows to pull in dynamic content: updating without page loads
* Gmail!
* Allows getting data from multiple sources

### AJAX Technologies

* Promise(s)
* XMLHttpRequestObjects
* JSON
* Asynchronous input/output
* The event loop

* Modern browsers have abstracted all those components into a single function called `fetch()`

### Fetch()

* Very new to browsers
* Older code uses jquery.ajax or $.ajax
* Web users expect sites to load quickly and stay updated
* Abstraction of all AJAX technologies
* A function that retrieves data
* Global method on window object
* Can use in DevTools
  * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API>


### Fetching data with fetch() => Let’s break it down!

1. `fetch(“going to pass in a string representing URL to data source”)`

  * Will return an object that represents what we got from the data source. Not the actual content

2. `.then(function(response){ return response.json() })`

  * Taking in a function as an argument that receives the response as its argument

  * Need to return content that we have gotten out of response
  * Response can have some basic functions but most important ones are `.json()` & .`text()`
  * Usually one line: returning content from response
  * Here is where you tell JS to ask network response to be turned into JSON

3. `.then(function(json){ }`

  * Use this data inside of json to do DOM manipulation

### JSON

* Javascript Object Notation
* A string that JS knows how to turn into an object
* A way to send a collection of data across the internet
* Formats and organizes data
* Allows for large and complicated amounts of data to be shared across platforms
  * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON>
  * <https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp>

### Objects

* Great at modeling more complex structures
* `key/value` based data structure
* A way to store all information in a single data structure while maintaining a descriptive naming scheme
  * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects>

#### What is an object?

* Collection of properties bound by curly braces
* Can point to values of any data type, even other objects
  * Empty objects `{}`
  * Single key/value pair `{ key: value }`
  * Multiple key/value pairs `{ key: value, key: value }`
* Key’s inside objects are identifiers for the real data we want from an object
  * Keys must be unique

#### Accessing object values

1. Dot notation - go to strategy

* To access a property with dot notation, the key must follow the same naming rules applied to variables and functions
    * Camel case everything
    * Start with a lowercase letter
    * No spaces or punctuation
* All key’s are strings
* Will not evaluate variables
* Should be used when you know exact name of property

2. Bracket notation

* Need to be strings
* Can also use bracket notation to access properties dynamically
* Comes in handy when iterating over objects

  * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors>

#### Modifying Objects

* Key word: destructive = modifying original values
* `Object.assign()` & `Object.keys()`
* Can use spread operator but this involves more code to write
* Data in a const pointing to array or object can still be changed but the value of the const can not be reassigned

* `Object.assign()`
    * Object is a global object that has a bunch of helpful methods we can use
    * Allows us to combine properties from multiple objects into a single object
    * First argument is initial object
    * Every additional argument is an object whose properties we want to merge into the first object
    * Passing an empty object to Object.assign() as first argument will create an entirely new object instead of modifying or overwriting the properties of an existing object
    * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>
    * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign>

* `Object.keys()`
    * Return value is an array containing all of the keys at the top level of the object
    * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys>

* Removing a property from an Object
    * `delete object.property`
    * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete>

* Arrays
    * Array’s are objects
    * Can set, modify and access properties on an array just like objects
    * For accessing elements in an array, always use integers
    * Be wary of setting object-style props on an array
    * All object keys, including array indexes are strings

* Object iteration

    * Looping vs Iteration
        * Looping is the process of executing a set of statements repeatedly until a condition is met
        * Great for when we want to do something a specific number of times
        * Iteration is the process of executing a set of statements once for each element in a collection

    * For loop
        `for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            // Loop body
        }`
        * Problem: using a looping construct to perform iteration.

    * While loop
        `let myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'];

        let j = 0;
        
        while (j < myArray.length) {
            console.log(myArray[j++]);
        }`

    * For of loop
        * Much cleaner
        * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of>
        * <need examples>

    * For in loop
        * Usually used for iterating over props of an object.
        * Only passes in th keys
        * To access value, need to combine passed in key with bracket operator
        * Does not iterate in order, so do not use on array
            * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in>


* Traversing Nested Objects
    * Objects in objects
    * Values in an object can be other objects

#### Asynchrony

* Allows browsers to execute multiple functionalities, efficiently,
* `Synchronous` => one thing after the other
* `Asynchronous` => All tasks seem to be advancing at the same time
* Looks a lot like event handlers
* Do this thing, go do whatever other thing until this thing is done then go back to it and do some work

#### What’s an API?

* Application programming interface
* Data or functionality that is exposed to the public for use
* We can use JavaScript to send a web request to an api and receive a collection of JSON in return
* You can find documentation on an api page to help out and give a road map
